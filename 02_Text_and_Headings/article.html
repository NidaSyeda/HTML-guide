    <h1>My Learning Journey</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm starting my journey in web development, and today I learned about HTML text formatting.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned Today</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use <strong>headings</strong> and <em>paragraphs</em> to structure a webpage properly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Learning HTML is fun! It’s like learning the language that browsers speak.</p>
    <p>I also learned that <strong>semantics</strong> matter — it helps browsers and screen readers understand content better.</p>
